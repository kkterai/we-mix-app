## Reflection

This was originally part of a two-month long project built during my fifth module at Flatiron School. Project goals included building a Rails api and a React/Redux front end.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to both create their own and group video libraries (the latter, the reason for the "we" in WeMix). I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

One of the main challenges was authentication, which I solved through research and video tutorials. You can find more about my process [here](https://medium.com/@kenlynterai/final-project-react-redux-decf320c29d4).
